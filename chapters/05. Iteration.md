# Iteration

## *For* statements
For loops allow you to iterate over a range of values or elements in a collection.

```julia
for i in 1:10
    println(i)
end
```

To iterate over a collection, you can use the `for` loop as follows:

```julia
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits
    println(fruit)
end
```

If you want to iterate over a collection and keep track of the index, you can use the `enumerate` function.

```julia
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for (index, fruit) in enumerate(fruits)
    println("Index: $index, Fruit: $fruit")
end
```

If you *only* want the index, you can use the `eachindex` function.

```julia
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for index in eachindex(fruits)
    println("Index: $index")
end
```

There are special functions that allow you to iterate over rows and columns of a matrix

```julia
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
for row in eachrow(A)
    println(row)
end
for col in eachcol(A)
    println(col)
end
```

### Exercises
1. Write a function that take a positive integer and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to that number using a `for` loop.


## *While* statements
While loops allow you to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
The code block below will print the numbers from 1 to 10 by incrementing a variable `i` by 1 with each iteration.

```julia
i = 1
while i <= 10
    println(i)
    i += 1
end
```

### Problems
1. There is a famous conjecture in mathematics ([the Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)) that states that any positive integer can be reduced to 1 by repeated application of these rules:

    1. If the number is even, divide it by two.
    2. If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

    $$
    f(n) = \begin{cases}
        n/2 & \text{if } n \text{ is even} \\
        3n + 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}
    \end{cases}
    $$
    Write a function that produces a sequence of numbers starting from a positive integer $n$ and applying the rules above until it reaches 1.
