# Iteration

## *For* statements
For loops allow you to iterate over a range of values or elements in a collection.

```julia
for i in 1:10
    println(i)
end
```

To iterate over a collection, you can use the `for` loop as follows:

```julia
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits
    println(fruit)
end
```


## *While* statements
While loops allow you to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
The code block below will print the numbers from 1 to 10 by incrementing a variable `i` by 1 with each iteration.

```julia
i = 1
while i <= 10
    println(i)
    i += 1
end
```

### Problems
1. Write a function that take a positive integer and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to that number using a `for` loop.
