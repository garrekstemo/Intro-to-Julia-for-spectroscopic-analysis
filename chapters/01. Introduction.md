# Introduction

This tutorial is designed to introduce students to the Julia programming language and its applications in spectroscopy.
Lessons are more like lecture notes.
It is intended for students who have never programmed before, or who have only done a little programming in another language. The goal is to teach the basics of programming in Julia, and to provide examples of how to use Julia for data analysis and visualization in spectroscopy.
It is not intended to be a comprehensive introduction to Julia, but rather a starting point for students to learn how to use Julia for their own research projects in spectroscopy.

## Getting started

### What is Julia?
The [Julia programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(programming_language)) is a high-level, general purpose programming language designed for high-performance numerical and scientific computing.
It is by default a [just-in-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) (JIT) compiled language, meaning that it compiles code as you need it.

The Julia community is small, but it has found a niche in scientific computing.
It is used by CERN to analyze data from the Large Hadron Collider, and by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory for modeling spacecraft and data analysis.
It is also used by many pharmaceutical companies for drug discovery and development.


### Why use Julia?
Any software can of course be used to analyze data, but I choose Julia for a few reasons.

1. It is designed specifically for scientific applications and has many robust scientific libraries.
2. It is easy to learn, borrowing good ideas from Python and Matlab.
3. It is responsive and interactive. It can be used in Jupyter notebooks or in the REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) in the command line. The VS Code extension for Julia also provides an interactive environment for writing and running Julia code.
4. It is fast, comparable to C or Fortran. So if performance is your goal, you can stick with Julia and do not need to learn a second language.
5. It is free, open source, and has a large and growing community. A modern, free, powerful, and simple programming language with a great selection of packages is a tremendous asset for any lab.
6. Reproducibiliy is a priority, and Julia has a built-in package management system that makes it easy to share code and reproduce results. This is essential when designing code for science.
7. I was sold on the excellent plotting library, Makie.jl. It is fast, interactive, and has a clean API.


### Install Julia and Visual Studio Code
1. Install the latest version of Julia following the instructions on the [official website](https://julialang.org/install/).
2. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. Install the Julia extension for Visual Studio Code by searching for "Julia" in the [Extensions Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia).

We will first use the Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) in the terminal. VS Code will be used later.
There are many code editors available, but we will use VS Code because it is free and widely used for many programming languages.


#### The Command Palette
Briefly explain [the command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and how to use it in VS Code.


### Exercises
1. Open the Julia REPL in the terminal by typing `julia` in the terminal.
2. Type `versioninfo()` in the REPL to check that Julia is installed correctly.
3. Your first program in Julia: type `print("Hello, world!")` in the REPL to print "Hello, world!" to the console.


## Files, folders, and environments
The concept of files and folders are reviewed and then a tour of Visual Studio Code is given.
Students create a project folder to store their tutorial files and future experiment code.
This ensures consistent data storage and analysis practices in the lab.
We also cover environments and how to create a new environment for each project.
This is important for reproducibility and to avoid package conflicts.

To the instructor: Do not show your actual experiments folder, unless it is *very* well organized (to avoid confusion). Follow along with these instructions with the students.


### Files and folders on a computer
On a computer, files are stored in folders (directories), where a folder can contain both files and other folders.
We want to store files and folders in a way that makes it easy to find and organize them.
It is important in science to have well-organized data and code for reproducibility.

Follow these steps to create a project folder for your tutorials and experiments:

1. On macOS, go to `~/Documents/` and create a new folder called `projects`. On Windows go to `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\` and create a new folder called `projects`. This is where you will store your projects while you are in the lab.

2. Inside of `projects`, create a new folder called `tutorials`. This is where you will store code for these tutorials.

3. Open Visual Studio Code and open the `tutorials` folder that you just created. This folder will be used for all tutorials, including analysis in the optics tutorials later.

4. Click on the new folder icon and make a new folder called `programming` or something similar.

5. Create a new file called `functions.jl` in the `programming` folder you just created. This is where you will write your code for the programming tutorial, including problems.

Please continue to use this tutorials folder for your analysis when you do experiments in later tutorials (by creating an `FTIR` folder for the FTIR lesson, for example). Next we will create a new environment for these lessons.


### Environments
In Julia, an environment is a collection of packages and their versions that are used for a specific project.
This is important for reproducibility and to avoid package conflicts.
The packages you use in these tutorials might be different from your experiments.
Also, loading lots of packages can slow down compilation.

First look in the bottom left corner of the Visual Studio Code window.
Notice that it say "Julia env: v1.11" or something similar.
This means that you are using the default Julia environment, which is the global environment.
In general, we don't want to use the global environment for our projects.
Sometimes I use the global environment for quick tests, but I always create a new environment for my projects.

To create a new environment, follow these steps:
1. Open the Julia REPL in Visual Studio Code via the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and find `Julia: Start REPL`.
2. In the REPL, type `]` to enter the package manager. (Hit backspace to exit the package manager and return to the Julia REPL.)
Notice that here too, it says `(@v1.11) pkg>` or something similar, indicating that you are in the global environment.
3. Type `activate .` to create a new environment in the current folder.
Now it says `(tutorials) pkg>`, indicating that you are in the new environment.
4. Now let's add the plotting package that we will use later, `GLMakie` and `CairoMakie`. I will explain what these are when we start to use them.

Notice that a `Project.toml` file and a `Manifest.toml` file were created in your project folder.
These files contain information about the packages and their versions that are used in this environment.
This is how Julia keeps track of the exact versions of the packages you are using and ensures that your code will work in the future.
This is important for reproducibility and sharing with other researchers.
If you close and reopen VS Code, the environment indicator in the lower left will say "Julia env: tutorials".

When Makie and its dependencies have finished installing and compiling, let's go back to the REPL by hitting backspace and learn about functions.

Below is what the student environment and file structure should look like after setup.

### Exercises
1. Download the Japanese language extension for VS Code.

2. Find the setting to change the VS Code theme from the command palette.

3. Try to open a folder from the command palette.


## Problems
1. In your `tutorials` folder, create a file called "hello_world.jl" and type `println("Hello, world!")` in the file. Hit Shift+Enter to run this line of code.
