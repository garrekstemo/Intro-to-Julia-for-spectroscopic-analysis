# Introduction to Julia for spectroscopy

This tutorial is designed to introduce students to the Julia programming language and its applications in spectroscopy.
Lessons are more like lecture notes.
It is intended for students who have never programmed before, or who have only done a little programming in another language. The goal is to teach the basics of programming in Julia, and to provide examples of how to use Julia for data analysis and visualization in spectroscopy.
It is not intended to be a comprehensive introduction to Julia, but rather a starting point for students to learn how to use Julia for their own research projects in spectroscopy.


## Why Julia?
Any software can of course be used to analyze data, but I choose Julia for a few reasons.

1. It is designed specifically for scientific applications and has many robust scientific libraries.
2. It is easy to learn, borrowing good ideas from Python and Matlab.
3. It is responsive and interactive. It can be used in Jupyter notebooks or in the REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) in the command line. The VS Code extension for Julia also provides an interactive environment for writing and running Julia code.
4. It is fast, comparable to C or Fortran. So if performance is your goal, you can stick with Julia and do not need to learn a second language.
5. It is free, open source, and has a large and growing community. A modern, free, powerful, and simple programming language with a great selection of packages is a tremendous asset for any lab.
6. Reproducibiliy is a priority, and Julia has a built-in package management system that makes it easy to share code and reproduce results. This is essential when designing code for science.
7. I was sold on the excellent plotting library, Makie.jl. It is fast, interactive, and has a clean API.

1. Programming basics in Julia

This lesson is a overview of basic programming concepts using the Julia language and the REPL.
The intended audience is people who have never programmed before, or who have only done a little programming in another language.


## Install Julia and Visual Studio Code
1. Download the latest version of Julia from the [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
4. Install the Julia extension for Visual Studio Code by searching for "Julia" in the [Extensions Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia).


We will first use the Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) in the terminal and VS Code will be introduced later.
There are many code editors available, but we will use VS Code because it is free and widely used for many programming languages.
