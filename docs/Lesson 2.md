# Lesson 2: Fitting to experimental data

Now it is your turn to write some code to fit your experimental data.
The file is mostly empty, but there are some comments to guide you.
Write a gaussian function, and then use it to fit your data, as in Lesson 1, and extract the pulse width.
You will need to look up how pulse width is related to the gaussian function parameters.
You will certainly see lots of errors while you are writing your code.
Remember to break your problem into small parts.
Build a small, simple part of the code and then test it.
Often, code will not work on raw data on the first try.
Try generating fake data and fitting to that first.
Then you can often find why your fit does not work with your real data.

Finally, plot your results and save the plot as a pdf file.
Now is a great time to explore the [Makie website](https://docs.makie.org) and learn features for making a plot look the way you want.
