# Conditionals
Conditionals allow you to control the flow of execution in your code.
This includes `if` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops.
It executes different blocks of code based on the value of a boolean expression.


## If statements
If statements allow you to execute code conditionally based on a boolean expression.

Here's a simple example that returns the absolute value of the input argument.

```julia
function abs(x)
    if x < 0
        return -x
    else
        return x
    end
end

println(abs(-5))  # output: 5
```

Here's an example that includes an `elseif` statement to check whether a number is positive, negative or zero.

```julia
function check_number(x)
    if x > 0
        println("x is positive")
    elseif x < 0
        println("x is negative")
    else
        println("x is zero")
    end
end

x = 5
check_number(x)  # output: x is positive
```

Now change the value of `x` to a negative number and run the code again.

What happens if you don't include the `end` statement?


## Loops
Now let's make a loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.

```julia
for i in 1:10
    println(i)
end
```

There are also `while` loops, which execute code while a condition is true.

```julia
i = 1
while i <= 10
    println(i)
    i += 1
end
```

## Activity
Write a function that returns the quadrant (1, 2, 3, 4) of a point (x, y) in 2D Cartesian space.

*Bonus: What should the function return if the point is on an axis or the origin?*

```julia
function quadrant(x,y)
    # add code here
end

using Test
@test quadrant(1.0, 2.0) == 1
@test quadrant(-13.0, -2) == 3
@test quadrant(4, -3) == 4
@test quadrant(-2, 6) == 2
```
