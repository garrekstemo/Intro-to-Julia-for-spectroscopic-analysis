# Conditionals
Conditionals allow you to control the flow of execution in your code.
This includes `if` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops.


## If statements
If statements allow you to execute code conditionally based on a boolean expression.

```julia
function check_number(x)
    if x > 0
        println("x is positive")
    elseif x < 0
        println("x is negative")
    else
        println("x is zero")
    end
end

x = 5
check_number(x)  # output: x is positive
```

Now change the value of `x` to a negative number and run the code again.

What happens if you don't include the `end` statement?


## Loops
Now let's make a loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10.

```julia
for i in 1:10
    println(i)
end
```

There are also `while` loops, which execute code while a condition is true.

```julia
i = 1
while i <= 10
    println(i)
    i += 1
end
```
