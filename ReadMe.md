# Julia Spectroscopy Tutorials

A collection of tutorials for new students in the Quantum Materials Science Laboratory at Nara Institute of Science and Technology.

These are coupled with experiment tutorials.

Start with the femtosecond pulse width experiment, then there is a three-part FTIR tutorial where students do the following

1. Make a cavity with gold mirrors and measure the cavity length from the free spectral range.

2. Fill the cavity with a solvent and measure the refractive index.

3. Fill the cavity with a liquid with a resonant molecular mode. Students measure the mode splitting using a double Lorentzian function.
