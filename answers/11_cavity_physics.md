# Answers to introduction to microcavity physics
## Question 3
Constructive interference. High contrast between refractive indices of the two materials give greater reflection. 𝜆/4 thickness means light waves reflected are exactly out of phase with each other by 180 degrees, causing constructive interference. Multiple layers means multiple reflections, resulting in high overall reflectivity.

## Question 4
“QMCs are planar Fabry-Pérot cavities whose optical length (m𝜆/2) is a half-integer multiple of the wavelength of QW excitons embedded in the cavity. The high-reflectivity mirrors are formed from distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs), alternate 𝜆/4 layers of semiconductor materials of high and low refractive index.

## Question 5
No confinement in the in-plane direction.

## Question 6
- In bulk materials the photon dispersion is linear (w = kc/n)
- The splitting between upper and lower polariton branches on resonance is larger than in QMCs.
- Difficult to probe properties of exciton-polaritons in bulk materials — polaritons must travel to the bulk surface to convert into photos to be detected in, for example, PL experiments. 
## Question 7
Photon dispersion is linear in free space and quadratic in cavity.

## Question 8
Strong coupling occurs when Rabi splitting is “significantly greater” than exciton and cavity linewidths.

Strong coupling regime: Rabi oscillations, bleaching of strong coupling, motional narrowing, coupled QMCs…

Weak coupling regime: enhanced emission intensity (VCSELs, resonant cavity light emitting diodes (RCLEDs))
